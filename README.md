# SDK code for [Peacher](https://peacher.app)

This repository contains the request, response, and parameter type used by the peacher API.

Additionally, this sdk houses a `SyncClient` that you may use to manage a jursidiction.

## ** WARNINGS **
- This SDK is NOT stable. 
- This SDK is poorly documented.
- This SDK is tested as a major part of the API integration tests. 
- I will update this crate without warning, and the peacher API will be deployed with the update.
- Your clients are likely to break as I begin the debugging process of external client behavior.
